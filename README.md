## Installation

### Download and Install

**[Download Claude-Usage.zip](https://github.com/hamed-elfayome/Claude-Usage-Tracker/releases/latest/download/Claude-Usage.zip)**

1. Download the `.zip` file from the link above
2. Extract the zip file (double-click or use Archive Utility)
3. Drag `Claude Usage.app` to your Applications folder
4. Try to open the app (you'll see a security warning)
5. Go to **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security**
6. Scroll down and click **"Open Anyway"** next to the Claude Usage message
7. Click **"Open"** in the confirmation dialog
8. Done! The app will launch

**Alternative Method**: Right-click (or Control+click) on `Claude Usage.app` in Applications and select **"Open"**, then click **"Open"** again in the security dialog.

**First Launch Only**: You need to use one of these methods the first time due to macOS security for unsigned apps. After that, you can open it normally.

**Note**: This app is open-source and free. It's not signed with an Apple Developer certificate ($100/year), so macOS requires manual approval on first launch.

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hamed-elfayome/Claude-Usage-Tracker.git
cd Claude-Usage-Tracker

# Open in Xcode
open "Claude Usage.xcodeproj"

# Build and run (⌘R)
```

## Setup

### First Launch

When you launch Claude Usage Tracker for the first time, you'll see a setup wizard:

1. **Extract Session Key**
   - Open [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) in your browser
   - Open Developer Tools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
   - Navigate to: Application/Storage → Cookies → https://claude.ai
   - Find the `sessionKey` cookie
   - Copy its value (starts with `sk-ant-sid-...`)

2. **Configure Application**
   - Paste your session key in the setup wizard
   - Click "Validate" to test the connection
   - Click "Done" to complete setup

3. **Start Monitoring**
   - The app will appear in your menu bar
   - Click the icon to view detailed usage statistics

### Manual Configuration

Alternatively, you can manually create the session key file:

```bash
# Create session key file
echo "sk-ant-sid-YOUR_SESSION_KEY_HERE" > ~/.claude-session-key

# Set secure permissions
chmod 600 ~/.claude-session-key
```

### Key Components

**MenuBarManager**: Manages the status bar item, handles user interactions, and coordinates data refresh cycles.

**ClaudeAPIService**: Handles all API communication with Claude's usage endpoint, including authentication and response parsing.

**DataStore**: Provides centralized data persistence using App Groups for potential future widget support.

**NotificationManager**: Manages intelligent notification delivery based on usage thresholds and state changes.

## API Integration

The application integrates with Claude's internal API:

```
GET https://claude.ai/api/organizations/{org_id}/usage
```

Response includes:
- `five_hour`: Session usage data with utilization percentage and reset time
- `seven_day`: Weekly usage data with utilization percentage
- `seven_day_opus`: Opus-specific weekly usage data

Authentication is handled via session cookie extracted from the browser.

## Security

- **Local Storage**: Session keys stored in `~/.claude-session-key` with 0600 permissions
- **No Cloud Sync**: All data remains local to your machine
- **No Telemetry**: Zero tracking or analytics
- **Sandboxing**: Disabled to allow file system access (required for session key)
- **Network**: HTTPS-only communication with claude.ai

## Troubleshooting

### Application Not Connecting

1. Verify your session key is valid
2. Check that you're logged into claude.ai in your browser
3. Try extracting a fresh session key
4. Ensure you have an active internet connection

### Menu Bar Icon Not Appearing

1. Check System Settings → Desktop & Dock → Menu Bar
2. Restart the application
3. Check Console.app for error messages

### Session Key Expired

Session keys may expire after a period of time. Extract a new key from claude.ai and update it in Settings → API.
